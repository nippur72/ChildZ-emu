KEYBOARD
========

A standard ASCII keyboard is emulated. 

- `Backspace` and `Delete` are swapped (they give `127` and `8` respectively)
- Left and Right Cursor keys are mapped to `<` and `>` (avalaible also via `Ctrl`+`,` and `Ctrl`+`.`)
- Ascii codes below 32 can be produced by `Ctrl` + letter or `Alt` + letter (because the browser prevent using some Ctrl keys)
- `NULL` is `Ctrl` + `0` or `Ctrl` + `@`
- `{` and `}` are `Ctrl` + `8` and `Ctrl` + `9`
- `LF` is `Ã¹` on italian keyboard layout
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `P` powers on/off the machine
